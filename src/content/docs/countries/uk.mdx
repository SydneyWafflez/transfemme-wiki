The United Kingdom, which is currently ranked at a 53 on the ILGA Europe's Rainbow Map, is an overall neutral country when it comes to being trans friendly. It has several controversial laws that the existing government failed to block or ban. Existing bans on laws, such as the ban on conversion practices aimed at transgender individuals, have not been renewed.


## The Basics of Trans Care in the U.K.
- Healthcare access: Transgender patients in the UK have 2 main routes to take when getting transgender care. They can use a private provider, or they can use the NHS's Pathway.
- Legal Protections: The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination against transgender people by making the “Characteristic pf Gender Reassignment” a protected characteristic. However, non-binary genders are not legally recognized.
- Support Networks: The UK has many transgender support groups, many of which are run by charities. Please see our Emergency Resources page for a basic list. More resources will be added to this page as time goes on.

## Starting HRT
You can take one of two paths when starting HRT. Please note, these different paths will have different wait times, costs, requirements and processes.

  <TabItem label="NHS Pathway" icon="seti:info">
    According to the NHS (National Health Service), transgender individuals may self-refer themselves to a Gender Dysphoria Clinic, as long as they are registered with a General Practitioner (GP). Referrals can also be made by an individual's GP, as well as any qualified medical professional regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council. Once at a GDC, individuals will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and will work with their providers to set up a treatment plan.
    
    Once a transgender individual wants to undergo gender affirming surgery, they must get 1 or 2 letters of referral. Mastectomy and Reconstruction of the Chest requires only 1 letter, any genital surgeries require 2. One letter must be from a Lead Clinician, the other must be from an “equally qualified and experienced professional that is not directly involved in the individual's care and able to form an independent opinion”. At lease one of the providers must have expertise in gender dysphoria. The letters must confirm that the individual has been on hormone therapy for a minimum of 12 continuous months, and that the individual has been living in the gender role that is congruent with their gender identity.
    
    The only clinic that is currently assisting patients who are minors is Tavistock and Portman. They will start you on hormone therapy at the age of 16. Puberty blockers are not available to children or young adults due to there not being enough evidence of safety and clinical effectiveness. The NHS does not recommend getting puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones from any unregulated or unlicensed providers.
    
    <Aside type="caution" title="Important Note">NHS clinics may have wait times that can extend for years. While you may be able to find private clinics that provide gender-affirming care, this will be at your own expense. Keep in mind that you will also need to continuously pay for medications and lab costs, as providers may refuse to refill prescriptions if you do not complete the required lab tests.</Aside>

  <TabItem label="Private Provider" icon="laptop">
    The top choices for private trans care in the UK are listed below. They are all listed in Britain, or are online providers. Most of these providers will be able to provide care and medical assessments through a video chat platform, like Zoom or Google Meet. Keep in mind, if you are enrolled in KOI (Knowing Our Identity) clinics, you may be discharged if you use a private provider. This may be changing soon, but as of right now, this is important to keep in mind.

## Changing your name
Changing your name in the UK is as easy as getting a deed poll. You can make one yourself, which is called an ‘Unenrolled deed poll’, or you can apply for an ‘Enrolled’ deed poll. Some businesses and government agencies will require a enrolled deed poll, but you need to be 18+ to get one. You can, however, make your own unenrolled deed poll as long as you are over 16 years old. Scotland does have additional rules, you can find out more information using this link: [Click Me!](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland).

  <TabItem label="Unenrolled Deed Poll" icon="seti:info">
    Using the letter format located below, you can make your own deed poll. You will need 2 witnesses who are over the age of 18. They cannot live at the same address, or be a close relative, as some businesses will not accept your document if they do. Once the deed poll has been signed by yourself, and your two witnesses, you can start using it immediately as proof of your new name.

    ```
    “I [old name] of [your address] have given up my name [old name] and have adopted for all purposes the name [new name].
    “Where applicable, I have informed the police that I have given up my name [old name] and have adopted the name [new name] and understand that a failure to do so is a criminal offence.
    “I also understand that when I apply for official documents in my new name, such as a British Passport, the relevant authorities may check the history and validity of my old name [old name] and new name [new name]. They may also check the information in any other supporting documents they have requested.
    “Signed as a deed on [date] as [old name] and [new name] in the presence of [witness 1 name] of [witness 1 address], and [witness 2 name] of [witness 2 address].
    “[your new signature], [your old signature]
    “[witness 1 signature], [witness 2 signature]”
    ```

  <TabItem label="Enrolled deed poll" icon="laptop">
    To have your name changed via an enrolled deed poll, you can put your new name on the public record by enrolling it at the Royal Courts of Justice. It costs £48.32GBP, and you must be 18 or older. You will need to fill out some forms, including a notification form that is to be sent to [The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/notice?categorycode=G406000002&location-distance-1=1&numberOfLocationSearches=1&results-page-size=10). You can send your forms and documents to the King's Bench Division. The address is below:

    ```

## Changing your gender
You can update your legal gender in the UK by obtaining a "Gender Recognition Certificate." This document allows you to update your birth certificate or get married using your affirmed gender. It will not change your legal status as a father or mother of a child. Additionally, you can only apply to be recognized as male or female, as non-binary genders are not legally recognized.

<Aside type="danger" title="Important!">You will not be able to update the name listed on the certificate once it has been issued. You must legally change your name before applying for a GR Certificate!</Aside>

You will not need a GR Certificate to update your gender on your driving license, passport, medical records, bank account, or employment records!

There are some caveats to consider. Your entitlement to certain benefits or pensions may change or be voided based on your affirmed gender. If you are married or in a civil partnership and wish to remain so, your partner will need to sign a document agreeing to the gender change. If they do not agree, you can still apply for the certificate. If the Gender Recognition Panel decides in your favor, you will be issued an "interim certificate," which can only be used to end your marriage or civil partnership. You will have six months from the date you receive the interim certificate to apply for an annulment, divorce, or dissolution. Once you are no longer married or in a civil partnership, you will receive the full certificate.

There is a £5 fee to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate, which is non-refundable if your application is declined. After paying the relevant fees, the Gender Recognition Panel will review your application within 22 weeks. They may request additional documents or information before making a decision.
