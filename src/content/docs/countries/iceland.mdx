## Legal Protections
Parliament act 80/2019 on gender autonomy governs the legal status of trans rights, including access to healthcare, in Iceland.

The act contains some key information that can be summarized like so:

“The individual” has irrevocable right to define their gender; to be recognised as their chosen gender; to grow their personality according to their gender; and to bodily privacy and to bodily autonomy (§3 Alþingi 80/2019).
Each individual above the age of 15, unless with parental consent at an earlier age, to change their gender registration with Registers Iceland, alongside their name (§4 Alþingi 80/2019).
It is illegal to demand medical intervention for this right to be exercised, including any surgery or hormone treatment.
The registration of one's gender as non-binary is permitted. Public and private sector operators dealing in the registration of gender must provide the option of non-binary registration (§6 Alþingi 80/2019).
Individuals with a registered gender different to the one assigned to them at birth shall enjoy all the same rights as any other person with that gender (§8 Alþingi 80/2019).
Registration of an individual's gender different from the one assigned to them at birth recorded by a foreign registry shall have the same effect in Iceland (§10 Alþingi 80/2019).
Chapter III of parliament bill 80/2019 includes, amongst other topics, protections for intersex children and individuals.
At the national hospital of Iceland an expert team on gender identity and changes to gender features shall be operational to assist patients, 18 years old or older, with information, advice, and treatment in accordance with the needs of the patient (§12 Alþingi 80/2019).
This summary is not exhaustive and more is yet to come.
