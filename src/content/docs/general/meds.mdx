## Estradiol
Estradiol is the most potent form of estrogen found in the human body, driving the majority of physical changes during transition. The most common types of estradiol are:

- Tablets
- Gel
- Patches
- Estradiol Valerate (Injection)
- Estradiol Cypionate (Injection)

## Spironolactone
Spironolactone is used to block the body's male sex hormone receptors (also known as androgen receptors). It significantly reduces the amount of testosterone your body produces. The most common forms of spironolactone are:

- Tablets
- Suspensions (Liquid)

## Dutasteride
Dutasteride is an androgen inhibitor used to prevent the conversion of testosterone into DHT. While it increases the level of testosterone in the body, it slows down facial hair growth and can help clear up acne. Dutasteride is available in capsule form.

## Finasteride
Finasteride is an alternative to Dutasteride that performs similar functions. However, there is limited clinical research into its safety and effectiveness. Finasteride is available in capsule form.

## Progesterone
Progesterone is commonly prescribed to transfemme patients due to its numerous benefits. While some benefits have limited clinical research backing, others are well-documented. Progesterone is available in capsule form and offers the following benefits:

- Increased bone density in the spine
- Positive Impact on sleep (Sources don't specify)
- Improves mood and reduces stress during estrogen withdrawls (Common before surgeries)
- Decreases Male Pattern Hair Growth
- Reduces the amount of oil on the skin
- Changes to body odor
- Increased breast growth
- Reduction in hot flashes caused by estrogen

## Notes
It is important to consult with your doctor before making any medical decisions. Many of these medications have side effects, such as an increased risk of blood clots, so your doctor can help create a safe and effective plan for your transition. If attempting DIY care (which is not recommended; please consult with a doctor if possible), avoid administering high dosages to speed up your transition, as this can be incredibly dangerous, or have negative effects.
