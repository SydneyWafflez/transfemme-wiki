Unfortunately, there are many countries out there that actively ban or heavily restrict trans care. This page will list out all known countries. Please let us know if any information on this wiki is incorrect!

<br />

<Aside type= 'danger' title='Notice'>The moderators/editors of this wiki do not condone violations of the law, regardless of the restrictiveness of said laws, due to potentially abusive/lethal punishments. If possible, please relocate to a country that does allow trans care. Be safe!</Aside>
