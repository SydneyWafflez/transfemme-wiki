    - If you're a trusted member of our community with a history of providing accurate and valuable information, you might be eligible to become an editor. Editors can create new pages but are not able to edit or delete pages created by others. This policy ensures the integrity and reliability of the information we provide.
    - If you are from a government body that controls, monitors, or is otherwise involved in trans care, and you would like to gain the ability to edit your country/state's page, please reach out to us via gov@transfemme.wiki. We will require verification that you work for said agency!
