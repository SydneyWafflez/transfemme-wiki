If you are in crisis, you are not alone. There are people who want to help you, and they are just a call, text, or email away. This page provides links, phone numbers, and other information for people who can help. 

Our editors are currently working on editing this page, making it easier for people to use. We will be providing international resources here, and adding national resources to each country's page.
